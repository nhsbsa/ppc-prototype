          <p>You need to have a valid maternity exemption certificate. You can get an application form from your midwife, doctor or health visitor.</p>
          <p>You can apply if you're pregnant or within 12 months after your baby was born.</p>

  <div class="panel panel-border-narrow">
      <p>If you lost your baby after the 24th week of your pregnancy, you can still apply for a maternity exemption certificate.</p>
      <p>If you have a miscarriage, abortion or stillborn birth you can use your maternity exemption certificate until it expires.</p>

          <h3 class="heading-small">Dental check ups and treatment </h3>

        <li>a MATB1 certificate issued by your midwife or GP</li>
        <li>your childs birth certificate</li>
