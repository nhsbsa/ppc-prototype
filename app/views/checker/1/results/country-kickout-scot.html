      <br>You get free prescriptions</h1>



        <p>Because you live in Scotland, NHS prescriptions are free as long as you have:</p>
        <ul class="list-bullet">
            <li>a GP in Scotland, and</li>
            <li>the prescription is dispensed by a pharmacist in Scotland.</li>
        </ul>

      <h2 class="heading-medium">If you have a GP in England</h2>

        <p>If you live in Scotland but your GP practice is in England, you are still able to get free prescriptions.</p>
        <p>You will need to show the pharmacist a valid Entitlement Card along with your prescription.</p>

      <h3 class="heading-small">How to apply for an Entitlement Card</h3>
        <ul class="list-bullet">
            <li>Get an application form from your GP practice, or</li>
            <li>contact your local <a href="http://www.psd.scot.nhs.uk/doctors/about-medical.html">Practitioner Services office</a></li>
