      <br>You get free prescriptions</h1>

        <p>Because you live in wales, NHS prescriptions are free as long as you have:</p>
        <ul class="list-bullet">
            <li>a GP in Wales and</li>
            <li>the prescription is dispensed by a pharmacist in Wales.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="heading-medium">If you have a GP in England</h2>

        <p>If you live in Wales but your GP practice is in England, you are still able to get free prescriptions.</p>
        <p>You will need to show the pharmacist a valid entitlement card along with your prescription.</p>

     <h3 class="heading-small">How to apply for an entitlement card</h3>

        <p>Your entitlement card should be sent to you automatically, but if not contact the Shared Services Partnership.</p>
