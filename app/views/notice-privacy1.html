  <h1 class="heading-large">Privacy notice</h1>
  <p>The NHS Business Services Authority will process the information supplied by you.</p>
  <p>This is for the purposes of managing your payment for prescription prepayment.</p>

  <h2 class="heading-medium">Your personal information</h2>
  <p>We have gained information from you. We will not share this information with other organisations or individuals.</p>

  <h2 class="heading-medium">Contacting you</h2>
  <p>We may contact you, by any method you have provided, to discuss:</p>
  <ul class="list-bullet">
    <li>your prepayment purchase</li>
    <li>our quality of service to you</li>
  </ul>
  <h2 class="heading-medium">Retaining your personal information</h2>
  <p>We will delete your personal data from our systems and files no later than 7 years after you buy prepayment.</p>

  <h2 class="heading-medium">Matching your information with prescriptions</h2>
  <p>We match information you give us against your prescriptions. This is so we can check you have a valid prepayment.</p>
  <p>We follow a step-by-step process for matching.<p>
  <p>1. We select from all prescriptions that claim exemption under:</p>
  <ul class="list-bullet">
    <li>Help with Health Costs</li>
    <li>DWP Passported Benefits</li>
  </ul>
  <br>
  <p>2. Each exemption category is randomly sampled until we reach the required sample size.</p>
  <p>3. We weight the sample based on the risk of fraud and error.</p>
  <p>4. We filter prescriptions out for certain products. Patients with prescriptions for these are exempt from charges on health grounds.</p>
  <p>5. We filter out addresses where resident exemptions apply, such as prisons and hospitals.</p>
  <p>6. We filter out specific patients may, for example if they are a member of a vulnerable group.</p>
  <p>7.  We match the resulting sample to confirm exemptions against the following databases:</p>
  <ul class="list-bullet">
    <li>NHS Business Services Authority Help with Help Costs</li>
    <li>Department of Work and Pensions benefits</li>
  </ul>
  <br>
  <p>8. If we do not find an exemption match, we automatically issue a penalty charge notice.</p>
